            <p class="paragraph2">
                I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early adult life, cooking
                dinner usually
                meant microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something that came from a box. It wasn’t
                until I got married that I started eating real food because I married a guy who cooks. I started joining
                him in the kitchen and realized that cooking could be fun.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Jaw-dropping centerpiece dishes require two essentials: salt and time. Preseasoning is
                the simplest thing you can do to make a good piece of meat great.</p>

                The red curry paste is spicy, but by controlling the amount of paste you can add.
